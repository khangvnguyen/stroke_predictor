# stroke_predictor

This project is a simplified version of a robust machine learning to predict stroke from basic screening of patients, intended to serve as a basic screening

### Data
Data includes basic traits of patients such as gender, age, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, bmi.

The label is 'stroke'.

Can be found in dataset_stroke.csv

### Model
We experimented with a gradient boosting model (XGBoost) and compare it with a Neural Network model and compare the performance against the labels.
